1- Watch the Khan Academy videos on fourier series:
Go to the website: https://www.khanacademy.org
log in, say you are an adult learning, select electrical engineering as a topic, and click the "see all (9)" on to the right or electrical engineering.  

Scroll down to signals and systems and click.  This will lead to 10 short 
videos.  The first is 5 minutes 12 seconds.  I watched it, and I will watch 
the rest of them.  The first looks promising.  We are interested in the 
Discrete Fourier transform,which is closely related.  The difference is a these
videos are about a continuous, periodic function.  Was are working with a 
sequence of samples every 2 or 4 ms.  We will be using a function to transform 
the time sequence to a frequency sequence.
Especially note the first video:

2. watch video discrete fourier transform at:

3- Read connect_series_discrete.pdf

4- I have not written the exercise on the DFT.  It will be:  Complete the exercises in fouier_exercises.ipynb
