 Please work these problems.  Show your work.   Select the method your want.  Work in degrees or radians.  Send me the results.  I may work though the problems solving them differently.

z1 = sqrt(3) + i
z2 = 1 + i
z3 = 4+3i
z4= 2+3i

compute 
|z1|
|z2|
|z1  z2|
arg(z1)
arg(z2)
arg(z1/z2)
conj(z4)
z3* conj(z4)
z3/z4
These should to be straight forward problems.  If I picked something that makes a problem hard or if you have problems, we can discuss on Wednesday.
